## 1. Install dependencies

Install package from your command line.

<CodeGroup>

```sh npm
npm install @react-email/eslint-plugin E
```

```sh yarn
yarn add @react-email/eslint-plugin -E
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm add @react-email/eslint-plugin -E

```

## 2. Creating a `.eslintrc.json` for your emails folder

To use the plugin it is recommended that you create a eslint configuration
specific to your `emails` folder because the plugin will not filter out files that are 
not email templates.

You can create a config at the emails folder of your choice (generally just `./emails`)
extending the config from your project and then add the following:

```json
plugins: ['@react-email'],
extends: ['plugin:@react-email/recommended']
```
